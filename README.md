## 🗄️ Cryptocurrency Database

The chatbot analyzes 5 major cryptocurrencies:

| Cryptocurrency | Symbol | Price Trend | Sustainability Score | Market Cap |
|---------------|--------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| Bitcoin       | BTC    | Rising      | 3/10                | High       |
| Ethereum      | ETH    | Stable      | 6/10                | High       |
| Cardano       | ADA    | Rising      | 8/10                | Medium     |
| Solana        | SOL    | Rising      | 7/10                | Medium     |
| Polygon       | MATIC  | Stable      | 9/10                | Medium     |

## 🧠 AI Decision-Making Logic

### Profitability Analysis
```python
def calculate_profitability_score(crypto_data):
    score = 0
    if crypto_data["price_trend"] == "rising":
        score += 3  # Higher weight for rising trends
    elif crypto_data["price_trend"] == "stable":
        score += 1  # Lower weight for stable trends
    
    if crypto_data["market_cap"] == "high":
        score += 2  # Established market presence
    elif crypto_data["market_cap"] == "medium":
        score += 1  # Growing market presence
    
    return score
```

### Sustainability Evaluation
```python
def evaluate_sustainability(crypto_data):
    # Direct sustainability score (0-10 scale)
    sustainability_score = crypto_data["sustainability_score"]
    
    # Energy efficiency bonus
    if crypto_data["energy_use"] == "low":
        sustainability_score += 1
    
    return min(sustainability_score, 10)  # Cap at 10
```

### Balanced Recommendation Algorithm
```python
def get_balanced_recommendation():
    # Combines profitability (50%) + sustainability (50%)
    for crypto in database:
        profit_score = calculate_profitability_score(crypto)
        sustainability_score = evaluate_sustainability(crypto)
        
        # Normalize and combine scores
        total_score = (profit_score + sustainability_score) / 2
        
    return highest_scoring_crypto
```
